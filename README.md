# Meetup Guidelines
This document should act as a guideline for meetups organized by the Angular Meetup Zurich group.
## Purpose
This document is a set of rules that apply to our meetups. It's important that everyone in the group has the same understanding of how meetups are held, what procedures are applied and what culture we try to establish with our meetups.
## Changes of this document
This document is open for participation and changes should always be handled with pull requests. Pull requests are a great way to start discussions and to find consensus.
## Meetup Guidelines
### Organizsers
- Meetup organizers should always discuss the organization within the Angular Meetup Zurich organizer group
- All meetup organizers are taking the responsibility to make sure that the guidelines discussed in this document are applied at any time
- The meetup organizers are responsible to make sure that the guidelines of the location providers, venues and agreed sponsors are respected and that we comply with those guidelines at any time
- The more meetup organizers join the organization of upcoming meetups the better but the organizational tasks should be distributed in an open discussion
- The more meetup organizers join an actual meetup the better but at least one meetup organizer needs to be present on a meetup event
- Usually the meetup organizers will meet a few days after a meetup to discuss open points and plan upcoming events

### Presenters
- Presenters are very welcome to submit their topic to the meetup organization group for discussion
- Generally topics should include the Framework Angular from Google to some extent
- We are looking for educational talks where members of the meetup group will learn new techniques, technologies, paradigms and the like
- We are also looking for project presentations where members will see an Angular project in a real life scenario
- Project presentations should be of technical nature and members should be able to see behind the scenes of the project
- Project presentations should also demonstrate technical difficulties and challenges faced with the Angular Framework during the project and how they were mastered
- Project presentations should NOT be marketing events and therefore advertisement should be limited to the technical demonstration of the product / project.
- The following information should always be present in a proposal for presentation: Presenters (who will present? Name, short bio), Level (What's the target group? Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced?), Title (the title of the presentation), Topic (a brief summary of that the members can expect from the presentation)
